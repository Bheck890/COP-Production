# COP-3003-Production Project
Object Programming Semester Project
I made this project by myself and used my prior personal prior java project experience to make it the best.
I created this project for my Fall 2020 Object programing class. 
The ammunt of experience I had was a bit of personal experience of a personal project 
where I allready worked with sql servers and FXML interfaces. 
This project was created as a assignemnt for my Object Progrmaing class. 
I worked a lot on this project and shows my coding style which should e easy to read.
I made this project In college at Florida Gulf Cost University, for my COP 3003 class.
